# SeeSynesthete
A chrome extension that allows you to experience the internet the way a synesthete does... 

By changing the colour of text on webpages, this chrome extension replicates grapheme-colour synesthesia. Synesthesia is a neurological condition that can stimulate multiple cognitive pathways, causing a multi-sensory experience. Grapheme-colour synesthesia can cause people to see letters, numbers and symbols with a unique colour when reading and writing. We encourage you to explore the world this extension allows in the hopes of increasing awareness of Synesthesia and the diverse ways individuals perceive the online and offline world. 

# FUNCTIONALITY
**** NOTE: This user setting will be coming in the next update. ****
Within this extension you have the ability to choose your own colours or apply the default colours - which are my own personal colours as a synesthete - to webpage text. Click on the coloured boxes in the settings and use the colour picker to apply your own colours. 

This extension currently works best on webpages without automatic refresh or infinite load such as Facebook. The text will appear coloured on the initial load of these pages, however will disappear as the page refreshes itself or as the user scrolls down.
